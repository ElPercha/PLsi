The total length of the mounting bracket was modified to adjust the distance between holes to 89mm
Also a cut off is applied to the left mounting bracket to avoid interference with terminal block.

Thank you CeltXRobotics for this awesome design.

# Summary

[EDIT Apr2019 - find newer versions of these parts in the collection here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3579883]

These are DIN rail clamps for popular FIRST Robotics electronics components - Talon SRX, Victor SP, Pneumatics Control Module (PCM) and Voltage Regulator Module (VRM).   DIN rails are industry standard lightweight rails that let you closely pack electronics without having to reach the backside of the mounting board - handy in a robot belly pan!   They are designed to be low profile so that they can pack below the deck of a 2" thick Versa-Chassis.

These clamps print as one piece, but contain moving segments and springs.  You can bolt or zip tie them to the components, and then they pop on to the rail with the help of a flat head screwdriver.   They grip the rail strongly, but you might still want a standard DIN rail end stop to keep the clamps from sliding along the rail.

The Talon clamp has  a little holder for an IDC connector we use for CAN wire.  You can cut that part off of the STL if you don't want it.

These designs can also be modified to hold other components such as the radio, rio and non-frc electronics

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Wanhao
Printer: Wanhao Duplicator i3 V2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm layer height
Infill: doesn't matter, but 4-5 walls helps
Filament_brand: generic
Filament_color: doesn't matter
Filament_material: PLA

Notes: 
These prints require a bit of bridging, but *no* support material so that the moving parts (springs, slides) print clear of eachother.   Depending on the z adjustment of your printer, you might have to use a knife to separate the first layer of the moving parts after printing.

The Talon clamp should be printed on it's side (with the little wall pointing up)

The PCM-VRM clamp should be printed on its back with the hooks pointing up
