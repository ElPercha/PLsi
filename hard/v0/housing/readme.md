The 3D design of the housing is composed by 2 models or main parts:
	"Housing Base" and "Housing Cover" 

You will also need 5 screws. Recommended size: #4 (3mm) x 1/2 inch Flat head.

The models were created using "Microsoft 3D builder" application, it is included in most of W10 Versions for free.
	As helper, the board model was created and it is included in the root directory.
	Also, the full assembly is combined in the "Assembly" file, for visualization purposes only.

The housing is composed by 2 main and 1 optional parts:
	
	1 - housing base
	2 - housing cover
	3 - housing din rail (optional for DIN rail mounting)
		
For each part, 3 files are included in the "cura-slicer" folder:

	*.stl: It is a direct export from Microsoft 3D Builder
	*.3mf: It is the Cura project (unfortunatelly it uses the same extension as Microsoft 3D Builder) 
	*.gcode: It is the file to be imported in your 3D Printer

Ultimaker Cura Version: 4.8.0 was the Slicer used to create these files.
