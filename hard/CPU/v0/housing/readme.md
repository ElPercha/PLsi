The 3D design of the housing is composed by 2 models or main parts:
	"Housing Base" and "Housing Cover" 

You will also need 5 screws. Recommended size: #4 (3mm) x 1/2 inch Flat head.

The models were created using "Microsoft 3D builder" application, it is included in most of W10 Versions for free.
Ultimaker Cura Version: 4.8.0 was the Slicer used to create these files.

	3  - housing din rail (optional for DIN rail mounting)
		
For each part, 3 files are included in the "cura-slicer" folder:

	*.stl: It is a direct export from Microsoft 3D Builder
	*.3mf: It is the Cura project (unfortunatelly it uses the same extension as Microsoft 3D Builder) 
	*.gcode: It is the file to be imported in your 3D Printer
